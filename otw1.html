				<h3>Language  </h3>
			<p>1. The method used for communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a way that are understood mutually.<br>
			2. It is a system of communication used by a particular country or community.<br>
			3. A <b>computer language</b> is a method of communication with a computer. Various ypes of computer languages have been developed to make our day-to-day working with computer systems easier which include:-<br>
			<ul>
				<li> <b><u>Machine Language or Machine Code</u></b>.  A set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Programming Language</u></b>.  A formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Command Language</u></b>.  A language used to control the tasks of the computer itself, such as starting other programs.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>General-Purpose Language</u></b>.  A programming language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Configuration Language</u></b>.  A language which is used to write configuration files.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Construction Language</u></b>.  A general category that includes configuration languages, toolkit languages, and programming languages.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Query language</u></b>.  A language used to make queries in databases and information systems	such as MySQL.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Markup language</u></b>.  A grammar for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, such as HTML5.</li><br>
				<li> <b><u>Style sheet language</u></b>.    a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents, such as CSS, and many other languages.</li>

						<h3>Protocol </h3>
						<p>1. Protocol, in computer science is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a pre-existing agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow these rules to successfully transmit data.<br>
						2. Similar to programming languages, protocols are based on specific rules and regulations for computing and are designed for efficiency. Each rule is defined in different terms and is assigned a unique name. Protocols specify the standards for communication and provide detailed information on processes involved in data transmission.<br>
						3. Protocols are established by international or industry-wide organizations. Perhaps the most important computer protocol is OSI (Open Systems Interconnection), a set of guidelines for implementing networking communications between computers. Among the most important sets of Internet protocols are TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP, and DNS.<br>
						4. A single process can be handled by more than one protocol simultaneously. This coordination of protocols creates a protocol family.<br>
						5. There are different types of Protocol which are existing such as:-<br>
						<ul>
							<li> Transmission control Protocol (TCP)</li> <br>
							<li>Internet Protocol (IP)</li><br>
							<li>Internet Address Protocol (IP Address)</li></br>
							<li>Post office Protocol (POP) </li><br>
							<li>Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP)<</li><br> 
							<li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) </li><br>
							<li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS(Secure)), etc. </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Difference between Language and Protocol </h3>
						<p>1. A programming language is a set of strings that are valid in that language.<br>
						 2. For a language to be useful, it also has to have semantics, i.e. what does a string in the language mean.
						For example, print('hello') is a valid string in the language Python and { "name": "zukerman" } is a valid string in the language JSON.<br>

						3. On the other hand, a <b>protocol</b> describes how machines communicate with each other using messages.<br>
						4. A protocol can define what messages can be sent when, what are the roles of the machines (e.g. client and server), etc. A protocol also defines the format of messages, which is a language, though it's not commonly called that.<br>
						5. For example, you can't really say that GET /index.html HTTP/1.0 is a valid string in the protocol HTTP, even though it's a valid HTTP client request.

						<h3>Palindrome </h3>
						<p>1. The characters read the same backward as forward.<br>
						2. Few examples of palindromic words are wow, mom, noon, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak,'Was it a car or a cat I saw?', etc.

						<h3>Prime Numbers </h3>
						<p>1. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.<br>
						2. A factor is a whole number that can be divided evenly into another number.<br>
						3. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. <br>
						4. Numbers that have more than two factors are called <b>composite numbers</b>. <br>
						5. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</p>

							2. <b><u>For Example</u></b>.
							<ul>
								<li>Question: Find the LCM of 3 and 4.</li>
								<li>Solution:</li>
									<ul>
										Given below is the list of multiples that 3 and 4 have.
										<li>3 - 3,6,9,<b>12</b>,15,18,21,<b>24</b>,...</li>
										<li>4 - 4,8,<b>12</b>,16,20,<b>24</b>,...</li>

						<h3>Factorial </h3>
						<p>1. In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.<br>
						2. In simple words, a factorial(!) is defined as the product of a integer and all integers less than the said integer.<br>
						3. Therefore, n!=n (n-1)(n-2)(n-3).....(3)(2)(1).<br>
						4. <b><u>For Example</u></b>. <br>
						<ul>
							<li>10!=10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1=3628800</li>
						    <li>5!=5*4*3*2*1=120</li>
						</ul>    
						5. The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.</p>
